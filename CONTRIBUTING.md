## Before You Start
- Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  
- Review our [Usage Guide](./docs/usage.md) to set up the backend locally  
- Check [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCodeChicago/hacktoberfest-2025-backend/issues) for available work  
- Review our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCodeChicago/projects/2) to see **assigned tasks**  
  - Comment on a task you’d like to work on so a maintainer can assign it to you  
  - This prevents duplicate work and keeps efforts coordinated

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch  
   - Suggested naming: `feature/your-feature`, `fix/your-bug`  
2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages  
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch  
4. Reference any related issues in your PR (e.g., `Fixes #123`)

## Get Recognized with the All-Contributors Bot
We use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) to recognize and celebrate all types of contributions. 

**How to add yourself:**
1. After your Pull Request is merged, comment on the PR or in a new issue with:
   ```
   @all-contributors please add @your-github-username for code, doc, ideas
   ```
   - Replace `@your-github-username` with your GitHub handle.
   - List your contribution types (e.g., `code`, `doc`, `ideas`, `bug`, `review`).
   - [See all contribution types here.](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)

2. The bot will create a Pull Request to add you to the contributors table in the README.
3. A maintainer will review and merge the bot’s PR.

**Example:**
```
@all-contributors please add @Alexandrbig1 for code, doc, maintenance, projectManagement
``` 

If you have questions, ask in your PR or open an issue!

## Guidelines
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages  
- Keep PRs focused on a single change (small & clear)  
- Write clean, well-documented code  
- If possible, include tests for new features  

---

## Dependencies & Packages
- All dependencies are tracked in `package.json`.  
- Please **do not install or commit new packages** without prior discussion.  
- If you believe a new dependency is required:
  1. Open or comment on an issue describing why it’s needed.  
  2. Wait for maintainer approval before adding it.  
- The `node_modules` folder should **not** be committed — it will be auto-generated by running `npm install`.  
- Always run `npm install` after cloning the repo to ensure your local environment matches the project.  

---

## Issues
- Use issues to report bugs, request features, or ask questions  
- Before opening a new issue, check if it already exists  
- Tag issues with labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`)
